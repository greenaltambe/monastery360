      "Kathog Monastery is located above Pakyong Bazaar, East Sikkim. The lineage holders of Saint Kathog Kuntu Zangpo founded it in 1840 A.D. Kathog Lama was one of the three pioneer Lamas who played a part in coronation of Phuntshog Namgyal as the first King of Sikkim in 1642 A.D. at Yuksam, West Sikkim. It is said that Kathok Lama, during his time, founded only one small Shrine known as ‘Kathok Lhakhang’ at Yuksam in 1643 A.D.",
      "Later on, due to the damage during the Gorkha war and frequent war tension, his lineage holders moved their Religious Centre to present place. The department of Ecclesiastical Affairs extended a marginal financial assistance for restoration works as the structure was damaged by earthquake in 1980. Later, the Lamas and devotees moved the demand for reconstruction in 1982. Due to fund constraints of the department, the proposal was forwarded to Culture department and funding from this department helped rebuild the monastery in 1990. Some of the main artifacts are: i.A Conch Shell:It is said that this conch shell came flying from West direction and landed here. ii.A foot long key: This key is said to be the key to open the treasure of mount Khangchen Dzonga. iii.A Small Tibetran Shoe: It is said to belong to a highly accomplished lama by the name Gyalwa Yeshey Phungpa. iv.A Metal Vajra: Blessd by Guru Padmasambhava. Presently the Gonpa has 40 monks and 35 novice monks.It follows Nyingma Kathokpa of Tibetan Buddhism. Presently, it is one of the major monasteries in East Sikkim and functions all the major ceremonies with mask dance."

      "Situated on a beautiful hilltop near Gangtok TV Tower is the magnificent Nyingmapa Monastery of Enchey Sangag Rabtenling. History: A Saint Called-“Drubthob Karpo” formerly a resident of Lingding Gangtok once went to Ralang monastery, South Sikkim for learning and practicing monastic education.He spent many years learning rituals under the learned Lamas and held a post of Chi-nyer or General Manager in the monastic administration.",
      "One day, a Jindag (donor) from Barfung came to Ralong monastery to offer a day’s prayer in the name of his departed family member. However, that day the weather turned bad and the fire in the Kitchen was not burning well. Following which, Chinyer Lama failed to serve morning Solthuk (rice porridge) and tea in time to the monks performing ritual. This undesirable happening displeased the Jindag who immediately complained against him and following which an argument started to such extend that the lamas had to interfere into the matter. The Jindag angrily told the Lamas to choose between him and Chinyer Lama. Eventually the lamas, seeing no alternative, expelled him from the monastery. However, that incident had been a blessing in disguise for him. The Chinyer Lama, on the way back to Gangtok, made up his mind to enter in meditation in a cave at Mainam Hill above Ralong. After few years of hard labour, he attained a stage of Drubthob or Shidha and acquired flying power. As a sign of his achievement, he laid his footprint on a rock there. One day, a hunter from Yangang village came across his cave and saw him. He was quite amazed to see him and called him ‘Drubthob Karpo’ which means- ‘White Saint’. Later, the hunter invited the Saint to his dwelling house at Yangang and asked for his blessing. Thereafter he flew from Mainam Hill and landed at the present monastery site. Afterwards, he built a small Shrine on this spot where he spent few years and later entered in meditation at Taktse hilltop. Thereafter he flew to Dromo in Tibet and then to Bhutan where he passed away to his heavenly abode. Later, a Hermit called ‘Karma Sherab’ came to the Shrine of Enchey for retreat. Amazingly, he, after few years, acquired flying power and flew back and forth between Gangtok and Pakyong making the devotees awe struck. Thereafter, this place became more significant. The Saint spent his later half of life in this Shrine and passed away. Thereafter the lineage holders of Drubthob Karpo, with their profound faith, developed the old Shrine into a full-fledged monastery in the year 1840. A.D. with establishment of 15 monks and gave it a religious name as ‘Sang-ngag Rabtenling’ which means- ‘Sacred Stable Place’. During the reign of 10th Chhogyal Sidkyong Tulku (1879-1914), it was rebuilt in the year 1908, in its present shape, which is an artistic adaptation of Chinese Temple of Gyanak Riwo Tsenga. The monastery performs its annual mask dance on the eve of the Sikkimese Losoong corresponding to the month of December- January. Today it is one of the major monasteries of Sikkim."

The buuilding has inter-locking system of wooden beams where no nails are required to hold them. These wooden posts and beams can be seen in the third floor. The monastery holds some interesting artifacts such as a belltrance of the Gonpa. It is said to have been brought from Tibet in the olden days by a trader who wanted to sell it to the Gonpa for five Rupees. As the lamas could not afford it they requested for a discount to which the trader refused. While the trader was on his way back without selling the bell the bell gradually started getting heavier and heaver until it became so heavy that he could not carry it any further. The trader, upon realizing that the bell was actually meant for this Gonpa, decided to donate it to the Gonpa at which point of time, all of a sudden, the bell became light again. He brought the bell back and hung it at the main entrance, apologized to the lamas and departed. This bell still hangs at the same spot. Other interesting thing to see is the Statue of Buddha at the main Altar, who once displayed its miraclculous power. One morning, a monk on his puja duty saw the statue sweating profusely. Alarmed by this incident the High Lamas were consulted. The High Lamas were amazed to notice that a small pox epidemic that was raging in the surrounding areas stopped spreading from this Gonpa upwards. Incredibly no one from this Gonpa and areas above the Gonpa were inflicted with the disease. The Statue is said to have absorbed the disease thus safeguarding the people of the surrounding areas from the disease. The Gonpa presently has 35 Monks and 30 novice monks.

When the incarnate Lama attained the age of maturity he went to Chumbi, Tibet where he spent his life in meditation in a solitary place and later passed away. Thereafter, a Lama called Choekyong who was the descendant of the Late Gomchhen Tenzin Nyida’s brother took over the charge of his Ancestral Heritage. After his death, the tradition was continued by his son Lama Ugen and later succeeded by his son Phurtsing Lama. However, after the death of the latter Lama, it remained defunct for many decades until one of his descendant called Lama Dawa Tenzin who had initially taken admission in Labrang Monastery, North and became a Nyingmapa monk and thereafter continued the tradition. He had demolished the old retreat hut and thereafter constructed a small monastery in 1951 during the reign of Chhogyal Tashi Namgyal (1914-1963). The lineages of the founder lama are known today as Tsangkharpa. So the monastery was named as “Tsangkhar Gonpa”which is seemed to be mispronounced as Tsenkar or Chenkar Gumpa. The Lama Dawa Tenzin by virtue of becoming Nyingmapa Lama carried out his religious activities as per Nyingmapa tradition. Later, his son Samten however revived the tradition of Drukpa Kagyu, which is the sub Sect of Kagyupa followed by his Ancestors. In 1987, Lama Rigdzin rebuilt the monastery and it is under his guidance that the monastery is being functioned today."

The XVIth Gyalwa Karmapa Rangjung Rigpe Dorjee founded this monastery in 1962. History: In 1959, H.H the XVIth Gyalwa Karmapa (1923-1981) and his retinue of followers had to leave Tibet after the Chinese invasion.",
      "His Majesty the XIth King Sir Tashi Namgyal invited Karmapa Lama to Sikkim where he made his seat for some years in the Old Rumtek Gonpa . Later, the King offered a piece of land measuring 74 acres for the establishment of this Centre to preserve the wealth of his lineage and spiritual treasures. The architecture of this four-storied building is said to have been based on the original style of the Tshurphu monastery of Tibet. The top floor of the adjacent building has a small altar where one can see a Golden Stupa containing the relic of the Late 16th Karmapa Lama and the Statues of the Karma Kagyu Gurus and the Past Karmapas. The Karmapa stated that Rumtek could be the proper site of his seat outside Tibet, although he hoped one day to return to Tibet. During his stay in Sikkim he imparted his precious blessings to the devotees of Sikkim. Unfortunately he passed away on 5th November 1981 into Parinirvana at the American International Clinic in Zion, near Chicago, USA. His Kudung (body) was flown back to India. On 20th December 1981 his cremation ceremony took place in Rumtek Gonpa. His holy crown, said to have woven by the Dakinis is still preserved at this monastery as a Ter (Religious artifact). Mask Dances are being performed here during religious festivals like Saga Dawa (birth anniversary of Lord Buddha), Guru Trungkar Tshechu (birth anniversary of Guru Padmasambhava) and Gutor Chham on the eve of Losar (the Tibetan New Year). Being the seat of the Gyalwa Karmapa, Rumtek Dharma Chakra Centre is now the International Headquarters of the Kagyupa Sect. Presently the Gonpa has 243 monks and 186 novice monks in its Sheda."

As per record, it is mentioned that the monastery belongs to Sikkim Darwar and functions under the care of one Lama called ‘Jo Pema Kunkhyab’. The Darwar had also granted Rs. 50/- per annum to Bakcham Gonpa for running pujas.",
      "However, during 1960, the Chinese Armies did not allow the public to visit to any monastery for pujas. This created a hurdle in the way of his religious activities and the Lama started facing difficulties after being cut off from Sikkim. Eventually, he deserted the monastery and escaped to Paro in Bhutan along with his family members. The news regarding his escape from Yatung to Bhutan had caused anxiety to the Darwar. However, later, Chhogyal Tashi Namgyal called him from Bhutan and allotted a piece of land at Dechenling, East Sikkim where he built a dwelling house in 1966 and continued his religious activities. Later, Jo Pema Kunkhyab lama, with the help of government aid, erected a separate shrine in 1990 to substitute the old monastery of Tibet. This monastery could not improve with time and there were hardly any monks even though Government gives an annual subsidy for its functioning."

History:Sang-ngag Cholingmonastery is claimed to have founded by Lama Lhatsun Chhenpo during the reign of first King Phuntsog Namgyal (1604-1670) but date and year of its founding is not specifically found.However, as per record found in theGazetteer of Sikkim, it is said thus- “It was commenced under the direction of Lhatsun Chhenpo during the reign of First King and brought to completion, at the time of second King Tensung Namgyal",
      "(1670-1700)”.As per record in ‘The Gazetteer of Sikkim’, Lama Lhatsun Chhenpo went back to Tibet for a short period in 1648 A.D. During this visit, Lama Lhatsun offered the Rigdzin Sogdrub Initiation to the Fifth Dalai Lama and conferred on him as Chhodag or Care Taker of Dharma. Thereafter, Lama Lhatsun and Chhogyal Phuntshog, after returning from Tibet, proceeded to demarcate the Rabdentse area as the proper site for building a befitting Palace in the future. Afterwards they went on building many other objects of worship such as Golden Stupa, Bodhi Stupa etc. At the same time, Lama Lhatsun consecrated many sites in the surrounding areas before returning to Tibet. Later, he passed away at Sheldrak monastery in the water-dragon year, which corresponds to 1652 A.D. Therefore, taking into account the time of his visit to these areas, the commencement of the Sang-nags Choling monastery must had been taken place during the year between 1649 and 1651 A.D. The founding date ‘1697’as indicated by H.H. Risley contradicts to the historical facts as its founder lama had evidently passed away in 1652 A.D. in Tibet. Later, Lama Jigmed Pawo, the third successor of Lhatsun Lama, reconstructed the monastery in the wood-horse year i.e. 1714 A.D. during the reign of Third Chhogyal Chhagdor Namgyal. The admission to this monastery was open to all i.e. irrespective of caste. However, this monastery is identified today as the second Gonpa next to Dubde Monastery. It is very unfortunate that the original monastery, rebuilt by Lama Jigmed Pawo, was gutted by fire in 1950, which was later rebuilt in 1960 with government aid and provided with mural paintings in the year 1981. Next to the Kangyur Lhakhang in the first floor is the Naychu Lhakhang containing statues made by Lama Lhatsun Chenpo. They are Buddha Amitabha, Guru Tsokye Dorje , Chukchi Shay and Lhatsun Chenpo. This is the only Lhakhang which contains the statues of the local guardian deities of various 'Nay' or pilgrim sites of Sikkim made by Lhatsun Chenpo himself. Among them is a statue of Thekong Mon Salong, the great Lepcha Chief who was also a powerful Bongthim (Shamman). This was the only Mon Salong Statue made in Sikkim. Outside the monastery is a Phagmo Lhakhang containing statues made by Lhatsun Chenpo. It is said that when Lhatsun Chenpo was meditating at this site, he heard the grunt of a pig and neighing of a horse at the same time which he took as a sign of the presence of these Deities. In order to please these Deities he erected statues of these two Deities along with his own statue. The monastery belongs to Nyingmapa Sect of Mindroling lineage and functions all the major ceremonies throughout the year."

The new Monastery was named as “Sangchhen Pemayangtse Gonpa” (Most Secret Lotus Summit- Monastery) and was started with an enrolment of 108 monks from the family of pure descents with the king himself enrolled as the first number. The Pemayangtse was specially built for the pure celibate and physically sound monk called ‘Dra-tsang’ and to its Lama was reserved the honour of anointing and crowning the Chhogyals during the time of the Monarchy rule. In 1965, due to its old age, the upper portion of the monastery structure was further renovated with Government aid by the lamas . At that time, the old structure of Sangdogpalri in the first floor of the monastery was dismantled during the renovation. However, it’s reinstallation was entrusted to late Serdup Dungzin Rinpoche, Jigme Wangchuk, who started the work on 23rd November 1967 with addition of many more missing items and brought it to full completion in the year 1972. \"Sangdogpalri \" the Guru Rinpoche's Heavenly abode, which is a beautiful wooden masterpiece, is the main attraction of this Monastery. His Holiness Dudjom Rinpoche, the Supreme Head of the Nyingmapa Sect, in 1972, imparted the consecration of this restored masterpiece. A small lhakhang near the entrance contains a statue of Dorje Phagmo (Vajra Varahi) which was presented to Chogyal Gyurmed Namgyal by Terton Terdag Lingpa of Tibet as a gift when he married his daughter. This statue is considered to be very sacred due to its association with the great Lama who was considered to be a master of Nyingma School of Tibetan Buddhism and whose student Jigmed Pawo established the monastery at present site. Its main festival is Guru Drakmar Chham in winter corresponding to the month of February-March. Pemayangtse Monastery has more than 100 monks at present and is a parent Monastery of all the monasteries following the Mindroling lineage in Sikkim."

      "History: Legend has it that Tashiding hill in west Sikkim is the navel point of the holy places in Sikkim from a religious point of view. A Buddhist Tantrayana Master called ‘Guru Padmasambhava’ had made his miraculous visit to this hill in 8th century A.D, along with his retinue of followers and recognized it as a heart of the holy places in Sikkim.But the damages by frequent earthquakes resulted several wall cracks, following which Lamas had to rebuild it in 1995 with the financial help from the Sikkim State Government.Presently, the monastery has 60-70 monks.",
      "Like Pemayangtse, it is a parent monastery of the monasteries following Jhang-Ter lineage of Nyingmapa Sect in Sikkim. The most important festival of this Gonpa is ‘Bhumchhu’, a sacred holy water ceremony, which is held annually and attracts a large number of pilgrims and devotees from Bhutan and other adjoining areas. Lama Ngadag Sempa Chhenpo introduced Bhumchhu ceremony in 17th century with a gift of a precious vase that he had brought from Tibet. The most holy Chhoedten(Stupa) in Sikkim is also at Tashiding. So sacred is it that the mere act of beholding it would cleanse all sins according to its name. Its full title is Thong-Warang-Drol and bears the meaning “Saviour by mere sight”. It contains the precious relic of Mythical Buddha “Wod-Srung” antecedent to Buddha Shakya Muni. Because of this reputation, this Stupa became a sacred object for pilgrims. Further, Lamas built many other sacred Stupas in the premises of this Chhoedten for different purposes of spiritual benefit for the devotees. Later, the lamas according to the order and at the expense of donating pilgrims built “Mendang” around Tashiding Chhoedtens. The Mendang bears mystic charms of the protective divinities of Lamaism and the pictures of the protective divinities carved on stone blocks. At present, the above Chhoedtens and Mendang monuments have become the most important religious heritages of Sikkim as well as of the Himalayas."

      "History:Ngadag Rinchhen Gon, the grand son of Saint Ngadag Sempa Chhenpo (one of the three pioneer Lamas of Sikkim), built Silnon Monastery in 1716 A.D, as recorded in Sikkim History by Chhogyal Thutob Namgyal. Whereas some authors believed that, it was founded in 1649 A.D. Nevertheless, the being a family man opted for settling at Silnon, instead of Tashiding and made his dwelling house there in 1649 A.D.It was not to be called Gonpa as some authors claimed. From there Lama Ngadag Sempa Chhenpo used to guide the monks of Tashiding Gonpa",
      "in religious matters. Rinchen Gon the grant son of Ngadag Sempa also lived here at Silnon.The Gonpa was said to have been built upon a pond that existed there and hence the site was considered auspicious. The present structure was built in 1992 duly dismantling the old structure. The main Altar contains the Statues of Buddha and Eight Bodhisatvas said to have been made by Lama Ngadags son Jampa Tenzing. Beside the Gonpa is a circular structure with three seats which is said to have been constucted as directed by Lt. Chaktha Rinpoche. One seat is kept for Chaktha Rinpoche while two others are meant for his previous incarnations Mani Sonam Rinchen and Drubthob Saraha. Nearby this structure is a Choedten(Stupa) which is said to have been erected by Lama Ngadag Sempa. It was built to protect the area against the attack of a demon who assumed the form of a five headed snake. This snake is said to have been slain by the Lama and to exterminate it he built stone Mendangs on its body which can be seen along the road leading to the Gonpa. Behind the Gonpa is a flight of steps going down to a cave, which is said to be the abode of a Serpent Deity and nearby this cave is a small sturcture housing a stone bearing a foot print of Tulshuk Rinpoche. Tulshuk Rinpoche was a highly accomplished Yogi from Ladak who came to Sikkim and resided at Silnon for some years. His fame came to the notice of the then Chogyal, who sent councilors to verify the antecedents of this Lama around 1960. To prove his accomplishments the lama performed a miracle by imprinting his footprint on this stone. However, the police personnel summoned him to report to Gangtok the next day. The following day, when the Lama was on his way to Gangtok but some people of Kewzing advised him not to go for they feared that he may get arrested. He was taken to Gyalshing instead where he stayed for sometime till some locals requested him to lead them towards the famous hidden paradise of Mayel Nay which is believed to exist in the Khangchen Dzonga range. The lama specifically said that the time for entry into this hidden place had not arrived but the devotees insisted on visiting this place. Finally after yeilding to the devotees requests, he agreed to lead the expedition during which he was killed by an avalanche on route to Mayel Nay. The monastery belongs to the Jhang-Ter Lineage of Nyingmapa Sect and it functions all ceremonies throughout the year. There are many sacred objects of worship in the vicinity of this Gonpa, which were created by highly revered Lamas such as Tulshug Rinpoche and Chaktha Rinpoche who visited to this Hidden Land in 20th century and spread the spiritual flavour in Western Sikkim."

Tholung literally means Tho or Thowa=means Areasima, Lung or Lunga means- place or country. Some people believed that it is ‘Dolung’ the stony place. However, it is a place where divine beings reside and purity remains.",
      "History:The sacred place of Tholung was unveiled by 4th Lhatsun Kunzang Jigmed Gyatso in iron-Dragon year of 13thRabjung cycle of Tibetan century which corresponds to 1760 A.D. Later 5th Lhatsun Pema Dechhen Gyatso built a monastery in 1789 A.D to house the spiritual properties. It possesses ancient holly texts, invaluable Art and Artifacts, which had been brought here in 1788 A.D. It is said that the Gorkha invasion from Nepal had caused havoc and fear to the Buddhist monks in the west during the reign of Chhogyal Tenzing Namgyal (1769-1793). Therefore the Lama Gyatso transfered all the precious collections, invaluable write-ups, religious objects and many other belongings of former Lamas and Chhogyals from Dubde and Sangag Choling monasteries, west, to the present place of Tholung via Yangang Gonpa, South. It is also said that the Articles were brought through Poentong route and kept for some years at a place called Fendey in Poentong Village of Upper Dzongu, North Sikkim. It is said that during the halt at Poentong the artifacts vanished and reappeared suddenly and one Vajra (Dorje) flew off towards Tholung. People carrying the artifacts followed the flying vajra which landed on a small pond created by a spring. Taking this as an omen, the artifacts were transported to this site and housed in a small Hut built on the side of this pond. Later, Lama Dechen Gyatso founded a small monastery upon this pond as Tholung Gonpa. It is said that the Lama Dechhen Gyatso went back to Tibet where he choose two devoted and trustworthy persons called Jo Tshongpon Dablha and Tagye Tshampo as caretakers of these precious belongings and sent them to Sikkim. The two mistook the “Tholung” for “Wolung” and went to Nepal and settled there. The lama learnt of this mistake after a lapse of three years and redirected them to come to Tholung in Sikkim.The descendants of the former still exist in that area as Tholung Nangpa family. They carried on the task of looking after the artifacts till the 1940s. Thereafter, the Ecclesiastical Department, Government of Sikkim took over the charge. The Nangpa family continues to be the chief patron of this Gonpa. The cold climate and moisture in the area is unsuitable to the holy artifacts in the Monastery. Therefore, the religious treasures kept in the monastery are taken out for sunning and airing once in every three years as ‘Kamsil Ceremony’ under the supervision of the Department of Ecclesiastical, government of Sikkim. In the process of ceremony, their blessing is imparted to the devotees as well. The present monastery was reconstructed in 1980, as the earlier monastery was dilapidated. The route to this monastery diverts from Mangan. It follows Nyingmapa Sect of Buddhism."

When he attained a stage of full monkhood he was addressed as ‘Labrang Kyabgon’. “Kyabgon” means in Tibetan- “Savior” the Title, which conferred to High Lamas but H.H.Risley has written in Gazetteer page No. 23 as “Kupgain” which is mispronounced and has no meaning. However,the founding date furnished by the Gonpa Management Committee as ‘1826 A.D’, can not be taken as an authentic date since it’s founder, by this time, attains 07(Seven) years old only. Hence the founding date recorded by H.H. Risley in his Gazetteer of Sikkim as 1844 A.D, is more logical and justifiable because by this time the founder attains the age of 25. The record reveals that the Prince later installed a precious bronze statue of Karma Guru (a statue of Lord Guru in Wrathful form) in this monastery, which is presently installed in the shrine of first floor. A major renovation was done in 1978 with government aid. Its walls are adorned with life like frescoes of Buddhist legends. Its structure is built up with typical Sikkimese architecture of ‘Rinchhen Surgye’or eight pointed diamond symbolizing the indestructible and only monastery of its kind in Sikkim.

Later, a Lama called Ngawang Kunzang Rinchen, a resident of Namok village, near Phodang, used to visit this Gonpa during his pilgrimage to Tibet. During one of his visits, he was requested to take care of the Gonpa as there was no senior lama at that time. He agreed to stay there for three years and he completed the Gonpa. After his tenure was over, the devotees requested him to stay in the Gonpa for the rest of his life. Chogyal Thutop too backed the local people’s request. Thereafter, the Lama came to be known as Lachen Gomchen. He passed away in this Gonpa in the ox year. The number of monks in the Gonpa increased with time. It was fully reconstructed in the year 1977 with financial assistance from State Government. Now it is one of the major recognized monasteries in northern Sikkim. Some interesting Artifacts of the Gonpa: (i)A small Casket containing a flat stone bearing the amazing footprint of the Kham Gomchen who stayed at Thangu Gonpa. (ii)A stone shaped like a ‘Tshebum’ or vase of longivity, kept at the Altar. It is said that one day when the third Lachen Gomchen Rinpoche was meditating at Deuthang hermitage he told his pupil lama Samdup that he would find some thing floating down the river flowing nearby, the next day and he should bring it to the hermitage. Early next morning he went down to the river and started looking around. About midday he saw a stone shaped like vase floating down the river. He grabbed it and took it to his master.

      "renovation. As per old records, the monastery was in existence before 1717 A.D. It is recorded that Panding Ongmoo* conspired the murder of her half brother Chhagdor Namgyal the third king (1686-1717) in 1717 A.D. for usurping the throne. But immediately after, she was put to death in this monastery by the order of \"Darwar”. The event of her murder clearly shows a testimony to the fact that the monastery was in existence before 1717 A.D. As per record in Sikkim's History by Chhogyal Thutob and Gyalmo Yeshe, it is said that - “After having performed funeral rites, a group of royal attendants proceeded to apprehend and punish her but Panding Ongmoo, at the time, confined herself inside the monastery by locking up all the inner and outer doors. The group found no way to get inside the room and climbed through the monastery walls by making nail steps and entered through its ceiling. Upon reaching into her room, they strangled her to death with a silk scarf”. Therefore, the date of foundation is corrected as 1684 A.D. based on the document furnished by the Monastery Committee, which justifies the related fact. However, Lamas erected a new substitute monastery in 1978, which was brought to full completion in 1982 with government aid. Thereafter lamas transferred all the religious properties from the old Gonpa to newly built monastery and left the old monastery as a state heritage under the care of Culture and Heritage Department, Government of Sikkim. The monastery functions all the major ceremonies throughout the year."

      "Doling Monastery is located on a small hillock, about 6 kms southward from Rabongla bazaar. Lama Rigdzin Longyang founded this monastery in the earth-dog year of 12th Rabjung cycle year corresponding to 1718. A.D. History: The Mongol ruler Junggar’s invasion of Tibet in 1717 - 1718. A.D. led to the persecution of Nyingmapa Sect and in this terror- stricken situation, some Nyingmapa Saints left Tibet and took asylum in the southern hidden lands.",
      "In the same year, Lama Dorjelingpa and his son Rigdzin Longyang also left Tibet and entered Sikkim. It is said that many years before, the son Rigdzin Longyang had obtained a prediction from Chhogyal Terdag Lingpa (1646-1714) about his future and he realized that the time had come for him to proceed to this hidden land. Thereafter, they entered Demojong with the help of the clues prescribed in the prediction letter and reached the present site, where they had built a small Hermitage and practiced ritual for some months. Shortly after, Dorjelingpa went back to Tibet, his son Lama Rigdzin Longyang started building a small monastery. At the time of its completion, his father arrived back from Tibet, consecrated the monastery, and thereby composed a prayer manual to worship local Guardian Spirits while instructing to his son to foster his lineage. However, Dorjelingpa stayed in Sikkim for a short period and proceeded to Bumthang (Bhutan) where, he had sent one of his younger son for a spiritual mission. As per written record of the Lama Jigme Pawo (1682-1729), Dorjelingpa and his son came to Sangag Choling Monastery in west Sikkim and met with Lama Jigme Pawo, who at the time became regent to the minor Gyurmed Namgyal (1707-1734) the Fourth Consecrated Ruler. There are many sacred objects of worship in its premises; such as a footprint of Khangchhen Dzonga’s Horse, which was laid on the rock during confrontation with Lama Dorje Lingpa and Deity Khangchhen Dzonga. It is said that Lama Dorje Lingpa called an assembly of all the local Guardian Deities after consecration of the Gonpa but Deity Khangchen Dzonga took it lightly as he is highly dignified Deity came one day late to Dorje lingpa’s command. By the time Khangchen Dzonga reached Doling the registration ceremony was over. The deity was infuriated when his name was not registered in the list of Doling Guardian Deities and demonstrated his power by leaving a footprint of his horse on a small rock located outside the gate. At the same time, Dorjelingpa also laid his footprint on the rock in counter to Khangchhen Dzonga’s feat. Seeing this the Khangchen Dzonga apologized for his late coming and pleaded him to include his name in the list to keep his dignity.The lamas preserve them until to this day and the stone bearing the footprint of Dorje lingpa has permanantly installed on the inner wall of the Manilhakhang along with the images of the Manjushri, Vajra pani and Dorjelingpa carved on stone slabs by Dorjelingpa himself. Due to frequent earthquake damages to the structure the monastery had been rebuilt in 1840, 1920 and finally in 1984. The monastery functions all the major festivals. Today the descendants of Lama Rigdzin Longyang are still exist and taking care of this sacred monastery. The monastery follows Nyingmapa of Kadue Chokyi Gyatso of eastern Treasure."

A.D.History:The fourth Ruler of Sikkim, Chhogyal Gyurmed Namgyal (1707-1734), out of distress caused by internal strife, disguised himself as a religious mendicant and went on a pilgrimage to Tibet.",
      "No one in that country suspected his royal origin, until he came before H.H. Changchhub Dorje, the 12th Karmapa (1703-1732),who recognized and gave him a warm welcome. The King was indeed surprised and felt himself embarrassed, as he was totally unprepared and had nothing to offer to such a dignified Lama. Therefore, he offered a promise to Karmapa Lama that he would build a monastery of his Sect in Sikkim and would provide befitting patronage to the monastery. In the Gazetteers of Sikkim, as mentioned “9th Karmapa ‘Wangchuk Dorje”, is totally a confusion with ‘Changchhub Dorje’ the 12th Karmapa. As per Karmapa Lineage record, the 9th Karmapa Wangchuk Dorje was born in 1556 A.D. and passed away in 1603 A.D. whereas 4th Chhogyal Gyurmed Namgyal’s reign commenced from 1717 to 1733. So history itself reveals that the 9th Karmapa WangchukDorje was not in existence at the time of 4th Chhogyal Gyurmed Namgyal. The Chhogyal, after return from Tibet, built a Karmapa monastery at Ralong in the year 1730 A.D. and offered Bhutia and Lepcha villages falling in the regions between River Tista and Rangit namely Barfung, Lingdam, Burmiok, Temi, Sangmoo, Yangang and Lingmoo as Jindag (Patron) for the newly built monastery. On its completion, the Rabney (consecration) ceremony was said to have performed by 12th Karmapa himself from Tibet. Amazingly, some Rabney grains fell on the roof of the monastery at Ralang, which was witnessed by all present there. A few of these grains were said to have possessed of by some lamas. The devotion and faith had taken root in people’s mind and soon monasteries of its kind spread to other parts of Sikkim. In the beginning of 19th century, an incarnation of one Omdze Lama of Shamarpa lineage was born to the family of Chhoedten Kalon in the village of Barfung, who was later enthroned as the Head Lama of Ralong Gonpa by 14th Karmapa Thegchog Dorje. During the tenure of this Lama, the monastery was rebuilt with bigger size as the earlier one became old and comparatively small to accommodate the increasing number of monks. When the monastery was complete, once again the Rabney ceremony was performed from Tshorphu, Tibet, but this time performed by 14th Karmapa Thegchog Dorje (1798-1863). On this occasion, many auspicious signs were observed, such as showering with rainbows and appearance of a Vulture that circumambulated three times to the monastery and thereafter flew towards northeast hill called- ‘Mainam’."

      "The date of establishment as 1841 indicated in Gazetteer of Sikkim might be the year in which rebuilding was commenced for the second time because Dr. Hooker,an eminent botanist,during his visit to this place in 1848 saw the monastery in the process of construction.

Soon after, Bermiok Athing donated 9 acres of land for building a monastery for the religious need of the local people. Accordingly, a Lepcha lama called Sonam Rinchhen took the lead in building a small monastery on the ruined site in 1914 as per the advice ofKyabje Sitrul Rinpoche (Chhogyal",

In the later decades, Sir Tashi Namgyal and Lt. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru the first Prime Minister of India visited this monastery. During their visit, they saw a beautiful Lake situated nearby this monastery, which added an extra beauty to the environment of the monastery.Therefore, the Chhogyal named the monastery as “Norbu Tsholing” which means ‘a place having Gem-Lake’. Since then this monastery became more important to the people living in the surrounding areas.

Seeing this, the Late Head Lama of Tashiding Monastery known as Gomchhen Ongden initiated the talks for building a monastery near Kewzing Bazaar south Sikkim. A piece of land was donated by a elderly person of the same village known as Antsho Mondal. Immediately after Lama Gomchhen laid its foundation. The main patron was Lt. Yongden Bonpo who contributed a cash of Rs.2500/-(Two Thousand Five Hundred) to start the work.",
      "Thereafter the monastery building was completed in 1974 with the combined effort of the villagers and donors from outside under the supervision of one dedicated Lama of the locality known as Shri Tshampo Norzang. Earlier, it was started as Mani Lhakhang with enrolment of few monks and Nyamos. Later it was developed into a Gonpa. Now Lama Norzang has built up a separate Manilhakhang in its premises for the female devotees to offer prayer and performing all the periodical ceremonies throughout the year ."
